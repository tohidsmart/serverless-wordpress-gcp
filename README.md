## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does this compare to AWS Lightsail or DigitalOcean App Platform?**
A: Those are also good options, but this solution gives you full infrastructure control with Terraform. You can customize networking, security, and scaling behavior. Plus, GCP's Cloud Run offers more generous free tier (100K requests/month vs 3.5GB-hours).

**Q: What about WordPress updates, themes, and plugins?**
A: See the [WordPress Configuration Guide](wordpress/README.md) for:
- Updating WordPress version
- Installing themes and plugins
- Performance optimizations
- Best practices

**Q: How is this different from other open-source repositories on GitHub doing the same thing?**
A: Most WordPress-on-GCP repos have significant limitations:
 - **No end-to-end Terraform IaC setup** - They use manual GCP Console steps or incomplete Terraform configs
 - **No one-click deployment script** - You have to run multiple commands manually and troubleshoot each step
 - **Outdated architecture** - Based on Compute Engine VMs or GKE, which don't scale to zero and cost more
 - **No documentation** - Minimal READMEs with no deployment guides or troubleshooting help
 - **Not production-ready** - Missing crucial features like private networking, secret management, or proper IAM setup

This repo provides a complete, modern, serverless solution with comprehensive documentation and automation.

**Q: Can I use my own domain?**
A: Yes! Cloud Run provides a default `*.run.app` domain, but you can [map custom domains](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/mapping-custom-domains) with automatic SSL certificates.

**Q: How do I access the WordPress admin?**
A: After deployment, visit `https://your-service-url.run.app/wp-admin`. Use the admin password from Secret Manager (run `terraform output wordpress_admin_password`).

**Q: What about backups?**
A: Cloud SQL automatically creates daily backups with 7-day retention. You can also enable point-in-time recovery for additional protection.
